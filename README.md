This script will restart your nginx-server.

If you are tired of restating your nginx-server, this script will help you 

Just clone the code in any linux server

give permission to the script file i.e
**chmod a+x nginx-restart.sh** 

and now you can run the script

You can configure this with cronjob, so this script will check once in every hour if nginx-server is running or not if not than it will restart it again.
